          Hello World! My name is Maryia Kukharenka. Welcome to my Final
          Portfolio for the Digital Communication class. Throughout this course,
          I have embarked on a journey into the world of programming, exploring
          the behind-the-scenes process of creating a beautiful webpage, getting
          familiar with the basics of machine learning, and the power of
          Generative AI.
        </p>

        <h6>What have I learned and experienced during the course?</h6>
        <p>
          Of course, I was already familiar with HTML and CSS, but I believe
          that there is no such thing as too much knowledge, especially when it
          concerns programming. So I continued to study these programming
          languages in more depth. Moreover, I have also learned how to use
          JavaScript to create interactive elements on a webpage. I discovered
          how to use Google Teachable Machine to train models to recognize
          images, sounds and poses. And I also delved into digital storytelling
          and communication using Ollama. Basically, I have learned how to:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            structure web content and make it interactive and user-friendly
          </li>
          <li>
            apply machine learning to real-world tasks like image recognition
            and pose detection
          </li>
          <li>
            convey messages effectively through creative and interactive mediums
            like Ollama
          </li>
          <li>
            think creatively to find effective solutions to technical and design
            problems
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Learning these skills is very relevant for designers. Understanding
          HTML and CSS is essential for creating web content, while knowing how
          to use Generative AI like Adobe Firefly or other similar tools can
          expand a designer’s ability to create innovative and interactive
          projects. This portfolio showcases the skills I have developed in this
          class. Each project included demonstrates the challenges I faced, the
          skills I learned, and the solutions I created. I invite you to explore
          my work and see how my digital communication skills have evolved.

      <div class="row">

          <p>
            For this project, I used Google Teachable Machine to create a
            website that can distinguish between Expressionism and Impressionism
            in art. My goal was to develop an interactive tool that leverages
            machine learning to classify and analyze artwork based on these two
            distinct art movements.
          </p>

          <p>
            This project not only demonstrates the practical application of
            machine learning in art but also offers an innovative way to engage
            with and understand art movements. By using this tool, users can
            quickly and accurately classify artworks, making it easier to
            explore and learn about different art styles.
          </p>

          <p>
            This project turned out to be very useful in everyday life. The
            website helps people quickly learn about different art styles and
            makes art education more interactive and accessible. Overall, it
            demonstrates how technology can make understanding art easier and
            more engaging.

            <p>Project overview:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                The first essential step was collecting a diverse set of images
                representing both Expressionism and Impressionism. These images
                were used to train the model to understand the unique features
                of each art movement.
              </li>
              <li>
                The tool allowed me to create a custom model that could learn
                from the provided examples and make predictions about new,
                unseen artwork.
              </li>
              <li>
                I created a website that integrates the trained model to analyze
                and classify the uploaded images.
              </li>
              <li>
                The final step was to test the website with various artworks to
                ensure the model's accuracy and reliability.

            For this group project, we used Ollama AI to create an interactive
            Dream Assistant. The bot’s unique feature allows users to continue
            their dreams using emojis. Additionally, we tried to give this bot a
            personality using prompt engineering.
          </p>

          <p>
            By using Ollama to create a bot that continues dreams with emojis,
            the project explores a novel way to interact with and expand
            personal narratives. It provides a playful and imaginative method
            for users to engage with their subconscious experiences to explore
            and extend their dreams, transforming abstract tales into visual
            storytelling. The project demonstrates how digital tools can be used
            to bridge the gap between personal experiences and interactive,
            visual communication.

            <ul>
              <li>
                We began by designing the concept of a bot that translates the
                essence of a dream into emoji form.
              </li>
              <li>
                Using Ollama, we built the bot to interact with users the way we
                wanted it to according to our idea.
              </li>
              <li>We created a website that integrates the Ollama AI.</li>
              <li>
                Finally, we tested the bot with different dream descriptions to
                make sure it worked well and provided meaningful emoji
                sequences.

          <p>
            While working on this project, our small group explored the creative
            possibilities of generative AI, combining two powerful tools:
            ChatGPT and Adobe Firefly. Our goal was to create unique and
            engaging content by merging text and image generative technologies.
          </p>

          <p>
            We decided to continue working with our previous topic about dreams.
            So, first, we used ChatGPT to create a plot for a bizarre, feverish
            dream and then asked Adobe Firefly to visualize it. To make the
            process more special and personal, we decided to focus on the
            references AI uses to create pictures. Namely, we used well-known
            Shrek memes as inspiration for the generative AI, so that the
            visuals created by Adobe Firefly are infused with the style of Shrek
            memes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Using AI to create content can be really exciting and fun. AI helps
            us explore new ideas and bring them to life in creative ways. It
            shows how technology can be used to generate something fresh and
            innovative, making the creative process more dynamic and enjoyable.

            <ul>
              <li>
                First, we came up with the idea of using AI to produce both the
                captions and visuals, resulting in fresh and humorous content.
              </li>
              <li>
                We selected the required number of memes and used ChatGPT to
                generate the plot of a fever dream not related to these memes.
              </li>
              <li>
                We divided the generated text into smaller prompts and asked
                Adobe Firefly to create pictures from it using the Shrek memes
                we provided as references.
              </li>
              <li>
                The final step was to combine all the generated content into a
                website to present it to the audience.
