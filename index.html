          Hello World! My name is Maryia Kukharenka. Welcome to my Final
          Portfolio for the Digital Communication class. Throughout this course,
          I have embarked on a journey into the world of programming, exploring
          the behind-the-scenes process of creating a beatiful webpage, getting
          familiar with the basics of maschine learning and the power Generative
          AI.
        </p>

        <h6>What have I learned and experienced during the course?</h6>
        <p>
          Of course, I was already familiar with HTML and CSS, but I believe,
          that there is no such thing as too much knowledge, especially what
          concerns programming. So I continued to study these programming
          languages in more depth. Moreover, I have also learned how to use
          JavaScript to create interactive elements on a webpage. I discovered
          how to use Google Teachable Machine to train models to recognize
          images, sounds, and poses. And I also delved into digital storytelling
          and communication using Ollama. Basically, I have learned how to:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            structure web content and make it interactive and user-friendly
          </li>
		  <li>
            apply machine learning to real-world
            tasks like image recognition and pose detection
          </li>
          <li>
            convey messages effectively through creative and interactive mediums like Ollama
          </li>
		  <li>
          think creatively to find effective solutions to technical and design problems
		</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Learning these skills is very relevant for designers. Understanding
          HTML and CSS is essential for creating web content, while knowing how
          to use Generative AI like Adobe Firefly or other similar tools can
          expand a designerâ€™s ability to create innovative and interactive
          projects. This portfolio showcases the skills I have developed in this
          class. Each project included demonstrates the challenges I faced, the
          skills I learned, and the solutions I created. I invite you to explore
          my work and see how my digital communication skills have evolved.
